                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 22, 2026</p>

                <h3>1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
                <p>At Digital ABCs, we prioritize simplicity, accessibility, and trust. We respect your right to privacy
                    and are committed to protecting your personal information in accordance with the <strong>Privacy Act
                        1988 (Cth)</strong> and the <strong>Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)</strong>.</p>
                <p>This policy explains clearly how we collect, use, and protect your information when you interact with
                    us.</p>

                <h4>Scope of this Policy</h4>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Our Websites:</strong> Including the Digital ABCs website and online client portals.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Our Apps:</strong> Mobile and web applications that Digital ABCs publishes or operates
                        (including apps distributed via the Apple App Store and Google Play).</li>
                    <li><strong>Our Services:</strong> Our provision of development, AI consultancy, and technical
                        services to business clients.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How We Work with Business Clients</h4>
                <p>We often build and maintain apps for other businesses. When we provide these services, we act as a
                    service provider (or "data processor"). This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We process personal information about their staff or end-users solely on their instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Our business clients remain primarily responsible for how that information is used and
                        disclosed.</li>
                    <li>We use and disclose such information only to provide our services, comply with the law, and as
                        otherwise permitted by our contracts with those clients.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
                <p>We only collect information that is reasonably necessary for our business functions.</p>

                <h4>Information from Website Visitors and Clients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contact Details:</strong> Name, email address, phone number, and business details when
                        you enquire about our services or sign up for a newsletter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Information:</strong> Details and documents related to your business that you
                        provide so we can deliver our consultancy and development services. This may include information
                        about your staff, customers, and technical systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Billing details required to process payments for our
                        services (handled securely by third-party processors like Stripe).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Additional Information for Our Apps</h4>
                <p>If you download or use a mobile or web app published by Digital ABCs, we may collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name, email, and profile details if you create an account
                        or sign in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content You Submit:</strong> Text, documents, images, or audio that you upload or enter
                        into app features (for example, text you send to our "Linguistic Decoder" or other AI tools).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Usage and Device Information:</strong> Data on how you interact with the app, diagnostic
                        logs, device type, operating system version, and approximate location (city/state) generated by
                        analytics tools to help us improve performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use your personal information to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide our consultancy, development, and educational services to you.</li>
                    <li>Operate, maintain, and improve our mobile and web applications.</li>
                    <li>Communicate with you regarding project updates, support requests, or administrative notices.
                    </li>
                    <li>Process payments and invoicing.</li>
                    <li>Comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AI Features and Third-Party AI</h4>
                <p>For some of our apps and AI features, we use third-party AI providers, such as <strong>Google
                        Gemini</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> When you use these features, the content you submit (for example,
                        the text you enter into a prompt) is transmitted securely to the provider to generate the
                        requested output.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Training on Your Data:</strong> We do not use your content to train our own models,
                        and we configure our usage to opt-out of model-training by third-party providers where this
                        option is available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where an app feature sends personal information to a third-party AI
                        service, we will clearly explain this in-app before you use the feature and limit the data to
                        what is reasonably necessary for that feature to function.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Client Intellectual Property and Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>We respect the proprietary nature of the work we do for our business clients.</p>
                <p>When we build or maintain apps for business clients, ownership of the app code, designs, and related
                    intellectual property is determined by our written agreement with that client. Unless stated
                    otherwise in that agreement, any personal information about your customers that is processed through
                    your app is handled by us as a service provider on your behalf and is not used for our own marketing
                    or product development, except in aggregated or de-identified form.</p>
                <p>We treat all "Project Information" as confidential and use it only to provide our services, comply
                    with law, and enforce our agreements with you.</p>

                <h3>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with trusted third-party
                    service providers who assist us in operating our business. These may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Hosting & Storage:</strong> (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS)</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> (e.g., Google Gemini)</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> (e.g., Stripe)</li>
                    <li><strong>Automation & CRM Tools:</strong> (e.g., Make.com, HubSpot, Trello)</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> (e.g., Google Analytics)</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Tools:</strong> (e.g., Vapi AI, Twilio)</li>
                    <li><strong>Contract Management:</strong> (e.g., DocuSign)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Overseas Disclosures</h4>
                <p>Some of these service providers are located outside Australia (including in the United States, the
                    European Union, and other countries). When we disclose personal information overseas, we take
                    reasonable steps to ensure it is handled in a way that is consistent with the Australian Privacy
                    Principles.</p>

                <h3>6. Security and Retention</h3>
                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>We take the security of your data seriously. We use reasonable technical and organisational measures,
                    such as access controls, encryption in transit, and regular backups, to protect personal information
                    from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure.</p>

                <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide our services to you, to meet our
                    legal and accounting obligations, and to resolve disputes. When personal information is no longer
                    needed, we take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify it.</p>

                <h4>Cookies and Analytics</h4>
                <p>Our website and apps may use cookies and similar technologies, and third-party analytics services
                    (such as Google Analytics), to understand usage patterns and improve our services. You can control
                    cookies through your browser settings, and some apps may offer in-app options to limit analytics
                    collection.</p>

                <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
                <p>Under the Australian Privacy Act, you have rights regarding your personal information. You may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Request that we update or correct your information if it is
                        inaccurate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Request the deletion of your account or personal data (subject to legal
                        retention requirements).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Complaints</h4>
                <p>If you believe we have breached the Australian Privacy Principles, please contact us using the
                    details below. We will respond to access, correction, and complaint requests within a reasonable
                    period.</p>
                <p>If you are not satisfied with our response, you may contact the <strong>Office of the Australian
                        Information Commissioner (OAIC)</strong>.</p>
