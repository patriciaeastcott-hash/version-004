                        <p>
                            I'm a single mum. First Nations. I've got bipolar, CPTSD, and ADHD. If you've ever dealt with Centrelink while trying to juggle mental health and parenting, you already know what that's like. It's exhausting, and the system isn't built for people like us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I struggle with authority and being managed. Always have. Something about being told what to do when I can see a better way just doesn't sit right. That's probably why I ended up building my own things instead of fitting into someone else's box.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's the thing about being neurodivergent: my brain sees patterns that other people miss. Where most people see "this is just how it's done," I see the waste. The bottlenecks. The stuff that makes you want to throw your computer out the window. That's what I build apps to fix.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've been the person employers love to hire because I tick the diversity boxes. First Nations woman, single parent, registered on their disability counts. Makes their reports look great. Then they wonder why I don't thrive in their rigid systems, and suddenly I'm the problem. I got tired of being someone's token and decided to be my own boss instead.

                    <h2>Beach to Bridge to Bush Logistics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The other business happened by accident. I started driving for an international cuisine franchise because I needed flexible income that didn't require me to sit in an office pretending to be normal for 8 hours. Turns out, I love being on the road. The driving, the travel, the freedom of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along the way, I started noticing local businesses that needed delivery support - especially seasonal stuff. A restaurant that gets slammed during summer. A farm shop that needs extra runs during harvest. Small operators who can't justify a full-time driver but need someone reliable when it counts. So Beach to Bridge to Bush Logistics was born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finding opportunity in the gaps is kind of my thing. When everything went sideways during the hard times, I looked at what I had - a car, time between school pickups, and a willingness to hustle - and turned it into something that works for both me and my clients.

                            I want to show my children that you don't have to sacrifice the relationships with the people you love to provide for them. That there's a way to make a living that doesn't mean missing their school plays or being too burnt out to actually be present when you're home. I'm building proof that it's possible.

                        <p>
                            The business world wasn't designed for neurodivergent people, or single parents, or anyone who doesn't fit the 9-to-5 mould. I build tools and services for the underdogs. For the people running small operations who just need things to work without the corporate price tag or the corporate bullshit.

                        <p>
                            Years in hospitality. Time in corporate finance. I've watched businesses hemorrhage money on processes that could be automated in an afternoon. I've seen people spend hours on tasks that shouldn't exist. My brain won't let me ignore it, so I build the solutions.

                            No jargon. No 47-slide presentations. If I can't explain what I'm building in words that make sense to someone who's not technical, I haven't understood the problem well enough yet.

                            I build things that work. Not elaborate systems that look impressive but take forever to implement. You need a solution that runs while you're busy running your actual business.
